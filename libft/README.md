## 📌 Description

**Libft** is a foundational project at **42** that involves reimplementing standard C library functions and creating additional utilities for string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists. This project serves as a **personalized standard library** for future projects at 42.

Additionally, this repository includes **Get Next Line** and **ft_printf**, including the `ft_dprintf` function, extending its capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom implementation of standard C functions (`string.h`, `stdlib.h`, etc.).
- Utility functions for **strings, memory, and linked lists**.
- **Get Next Line**: Efficient reading from file descriptors.
- **ft_printf**: Custom printf implementation with an extended `ft_dprintf` function.
- A useful base library for larger projects.
